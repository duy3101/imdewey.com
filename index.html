    <h2 class = "modh2">About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone! Currently I am a student at the University of Washington Bothell. The purpose of this website
            is to present a portfolio of myself. I started learning how to code during my second year at Western Washington
            University. Since then, I have been very interested in the field of computer science. One day, I want to make something
            on my own that is viable for everyone to use.
        </p>

        <p>When working in a group, I enjoy sharing my opinions as well as learning from others. I believe collaboration and
            teamwork improve worklife. I am looking for a summer internship for Summer 2019. I'm hoping I could 
            bring my skills and my leadership experiences to my future workplace.
        
        </p>

    <h3 class = "modh3">Twitter Sentiment Analysis (Python)</h3>
    <p>The program asks for a word from user input. I made a parser to parse through .JSON files given from Twitter to find all the tweets that have the word in them.
        I used a list of sentiment values to determine a sentiment value for each tweet. By using the location that was embedded
        in each tweet, I calculated the average sentiment for each state in the U.S. Finally, the program generate
        a map of the United States that indicates a color of each state (blue to red - negative to postive).   
    </p> 

    <h3 class = "modh3">Maze Solving Algorithm (Java)</h3>
    <p>The program takes in a 2d grid. Inside the grid, there are 0's for the walls and 1's for the paths. The letter 'S' indicates the 
        start point and 'E' indicates the end point. I made a maze solving algorithm to find the shortest solution path as well 
        as backtracking when there is a dead end. </p>

    <h3 class = "modh3">Library Database (Java)</h3>

    <p>I used linked lists to create a libary database. Inside a Book class contains the
        ISBN number, inventory number and a back-order linked list. There is also a BookCollection class
        that manages the transactions (check-in, check-out) for all the books.
