        <p>Hi everyone! Currently I am a student at the University of Washington Bothell. The purpose of this website
            is to present a portfolio of myself. I started learning how to code during my second year at Western Washington
            University. Since then, I have been very interested in the field of computer science. One day, I want to make something
            on my own that is viable for everyone to use.
        </p>

        <p>When working in a group, I enjoy sharing my opinions as well as learning from others. I believe collaboration and
            teamwork improve worklife. I am looking for a summer internship for Summer 2019. I'm hoping I could 
            bring my skills and my leadership experiences to my future workplace.
        
        </p>
